#LITE ClockTower
# Moving clock inside of an hour so its a clockclocktower in a sunny day.
#The clock will revolve with both the hour and and minute hand moving in cohesion.
#The buildings are made by using for loops of rectangles stacking up on to each other
#The goal and purpose is to create a working clock tower which has a moving hour and minute hand. 
#create an array with colors
#creates the rectangular part of the tower by using basic commands such as forward() and right()/left() and filling it with a color
#creates the triangle on top of the building by using basic commands
#imports a clock image for the tower and sets in in the middle of the clock tower by importing image on new turtle
#Creates the bricks for the building by using white lines
#We can create this by using for loops horizontally and vertically
#Creates horizontal lines for the bricks. Uses for loop to create a white line for every 50 coordinates of the tower
#Creates the vertical lines for the bricks. Uses for loop to create a white line for each brick while skipping every 1 brick.
#creates vertical lines for the bricks again. Uses for loop to create a white line for each brick while skipping every 1 brick.
# creates turtle's for the hand's, erasers and clock center.
#creates the center of the clock by constantly iterating it on the animation
#rotation of the hour hand by inserting a new arrow hand in front of him
#we can do this by creating a new minutehand for every iteration
#rotation of the white minutehand eraser which deletes previous animation
#we can do this by making a white minute hand to delete the previous animation
#This works by inserting a white arrow on the previous animation to make it seem as though there is animation
#rotation of the hour hand by inserting a new arrow hand in front of it
#this works in the same process as the minutehand mentioned above.
#rotation of the white hour hand eraser which deletes previous animation
#this works in the same process as the minutehand mentioned above.
#This works by inserting a white half arrow on the previous animation to make it seem as though this is an animation. Deletes previous animation
# for an unlimited number of times run the clock. X is true. While x is true, move the clock. Infinite while loop
